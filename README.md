## Installations methods

There are two installations the `full` and `lightweight` version.
As the names ascribe, the `full` version is a fully featured KDE Plasma desktop and the `light` version uses an LXQt desktop with minimal tools.

### full
The `full` version is intended as a desktop replacement with many tools such as modern browsers etc. Therefore RAM and storage consumption may be higher than on the `light` version.

### light
The `light` version is intended as an emergency USB-bootstick with only necessary tools. Therefore RAM and storage consumption may be lower than on the `full` version.
