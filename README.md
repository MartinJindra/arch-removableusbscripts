# Installations methods

There are two installations the `full` and `light` version.
As the names ascribe, the `full` version is a fully featured KDE Plasma desktop and the `light` version uses an LXQt desktop with minimal tools.

## full
The `full` version is intended as a desktop replacement with many tools such as modern browsers etc. Therefore RAM and storage consumption may be higher than on the `light` version.

## light
The `light` version is intended as an emergency USB-bootstick with only necessary tools. Therefore RAM (300 MB) and storage consumption may be lower than on the `full` version. The reason this installation has less stuff and more lightweight alternatives installed is because the `light` version should be usable on even very old laptops, desktops and USB 2.0 sticks. The experience may still not be pleasant though.
